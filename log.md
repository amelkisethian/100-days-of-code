### Day 1: January 03, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Made adjustments to my Free Code Camp tribute page. Added base CSS @media queries. Tweaked the timeline container and font style. 

**Thoughts:** Began this page quite awhile ago so took some time to get back up to speed with CSS and particulary bootstrap responsive coding. Threw out a relatively complicated CSS timeline and made it a more simplified bulletpoint list.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
