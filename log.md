# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Made adjustments to my Free Code Camp tribute page. Added base CSS @media queries. Tweaked the timeline container and font style. 

**Thoughts:** Began this page quite awhile ago so took some time to get back up to speed with CSS and particulary bootstrap responsive coding. Threw out a relatively complicated CSS timeline and made it a more simplified bulletpoint list.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent time playing around with repsonsive design. I experimented and found something that worked though likely not the best approach. 

**Thoughts**: Tried several different CSS methods to make the page more responsive. Had issues with min-width/max-width @media queries. When I used a version without the "min-width" the responsiveness was present but not if I included. Thinking there is a better, more bootstrappy way to acomplish the responsive task. Will tackle it again tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More responsive hijinks. Tweaking @meda queries and container divs to make tribute work accross many devices.
**Thoughts** Getting the responsiveness right is fairly challenging. Using @media queries and trying to adapt for at least iphone and ipad. It's pretty challenging even though I tried to make the page as simple as possible -- 1 column, centered text.

### Day 4/5/6: January 6-8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Combining these days because I'm lazy and worked on pretty much only responsiveness the past three days! Used background-color, temporarily, to help with figuring out what the @media queries were targeting. That worked out nicely. Added realy content, a quote, an hr element, and another image. 

**Thoughts**: Tried several different CSS methods to make the page more responsive finally was able to figure out how to use max- and min-width.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Finished my tribute page. Added last responsiveness tweaks, a bottom image adjustment, and adjusted the block quote. Started working on finishing my portfolio page.

**Thoughts**: Happy to be finished. It's not the most complex design but I'd rather start small and build up to harder projects then get overwhelmed in the beginning and bail.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Portfolio page. Adjusted nav headers, added some thumbnails to the portfolio section, wrapped the body rows in a container to adjut the left margin. 

**Thoughts**: Not loving the thumbnail formatting. Using the bootstrap .thumbnail class which is convenient but I'd like to remove the white box-shadow.

### Day 9/10/11: January 11-13, 2017 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: More Portfolio page. Added social media fa icons, a contact form, adjusted the thumbnail section. Spent sometime doing bash command tutorials via lynda.com. Collapsed three days into one, know it's cheating but it's better than giving up on the challange entirely ;)

**Thoughts**: Still not loving the thumbnail formatting. Using the bootstrap .thumbnail class which is convenient but I'm going to scratch I think. I'm graphic design nerd at heart so gotta make it look pretty! Also need to work on the Contact section columns some more, at some widths the fa social media section overlaps the form. No bueno.

### Day 12/13/14: January 20-22, 2017 
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Finished portfolio page Free Code Camp challange. 

**Thoughts**: I will probably go back and tweak it some more -- I will need to add actual design thumbnails once I have some to show. But done for now. It's got links, made the nav bar affix, added responsiveness media query for small screens so the form in the contact section does not get cut off. Also added .container .body code to prevent side-scrolling in small screens.
