# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Made adjustments to my Free Code Camp tribute page. Added base CSS @media queries. Tweaked the timeline container and font style. 

**Thoughts:** Began this page quite awhile ago so took some time to get back up to speed with CSS and particulary bootstrap responsive coding. Threw out a relatively complicated CSS timeline and made it a more simplified bulletpoint list.

### Day 2: January 04, 2017 (Example 2)

**Today's Progress**: Spent time playing around with repsonsive design. I experimented and found something that worked though likely not the best approach. 

**Thoughts**: Tried several different CSS methods to make the page more responsive. Had issues with min-width/max-width @media queries. When I used a version without the "min-width" the responsiveness was present but not if I included. Thinking there is a better, more bootstrappy way to acomplish the responsive task. Will tackle it again tomorrow.

### Day 3: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More responsice hijinks. Tweaking @meda queries and container divs to make tribute work accross many devices.
**Thoughts** Getting the responsiveness right is fairly challenging. Using @media queries and trying to adapt for at least iphone and ipad. It's pretty challenging even though I tried to make the page as simple as possible -- 1 column, centered text.
